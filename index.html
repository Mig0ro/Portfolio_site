    <b>About</b>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Miguel Oropeza. I'm passionate about software engineering
        and really anything relating to technology. I love figuring out how things like coding
        are done correctly and effeciently. My favorite type of work so far is making websites using 
        HTML, CSS, and Javascript.<br />

        I originally began my college journey at Glen Oaks Community College where I graduted with my 
        Associate of Arts degree in Computer Science in 2025. Now, I'm at Grand Valley State University
        continuing my education in hopes of graduating with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.<br />

        In my spare time, I enjoy practicing coding problems on Leetcode, keeping up with the most recent
        tech news, photograpy, and spending time with my family as well as my girlfriend.
